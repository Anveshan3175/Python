The lambda operator or lambda function is a way to create small anonymous functions, i.e. functions without a name. These functions are throw-away functions, i.e. they are just needed where they have been created. Lambda functions are mainly used in combination with the functions filter(), map() and reduce().

>>> def operation(oper):
...     if oper == 'sum':
...         return lambda x,y:x + y
...     if oper == 'diff':
...         return lambda x,y:x - y

>>> addf = operation('sum')
>>> type(addf)
<class 'function'>
>>> addf(10,34)
44
>>> diffF = operation('diff')
>>> diffF(45,23)
22
