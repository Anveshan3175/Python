Numbers :
-> The interpreter acts as a simple calculator.
-> The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int
-> The ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float
-> Division (/) always returns a float
-> To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator
->  To calculate the remainder you can use %
