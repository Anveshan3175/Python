Why is programming useful to you ?
Fundamentally, you live in a world surrounded by data.So we need to collect that data, manipulate it and analyse it in a way useful to us. So programming is great.

Why Python ?
1. What do you want to do programming for ? Some people like to build games because they are fun, someone like to build websites, someone like to analyse data etc. So with python you can do almost anything you are interested in . Python is very versatile language.We can use python to do almost anything like
-> Analyse data
-> Build websites
-> You can maintain servers
-> You can work with music
-> Currently it is having great demand..Employers want to hire you if you know Python.


2. Python is very much like English. It has low syntatic overhead.We can get useful work done very quickly in python. Many education instituitions switched to Python like MIT.

3. Python can be used to build beautiful websites. Django is the web framework.For ex:http://greatandhra.com/ Instagram,firefox website,pinterest are all build using django

4. Python is used in data analysis and graphing visulaizations. There is popular library  called "matpotlib".It uses set of python tools. All kinds of graphs can be drawn- pi charts,3d charts. You can even make movies in matpotlib. We can build physics simulations. The molecule visualization tools like primo uses python.

5. We can build games using python. THere is popular library called pygames. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

6. For musicians we have echonest api. It is used to make and manipulate music. For ex,we can cut music into snippets for analysis and manipulate snippets using echonest API.

7. Python is simple and small learning curve
---------
1. Python can be used as normal calculator.
 -> If the operands are not decimals, then result will not be decimals. This is in python2.
    For ex: 5/2 = 2
            5.0/2 = 2.5  (Atleast one of the numbers is decimal)
    So we have 2 types of numbers - integers (no demical places) and floats (has decimal floats)
 -> In python3, 5/2 = 2.5
